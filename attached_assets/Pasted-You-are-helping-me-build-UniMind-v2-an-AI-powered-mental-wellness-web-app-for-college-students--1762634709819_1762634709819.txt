You are helping me build **UniMind v2**, an AI-powered mental wellness web app for college students.

🧠 **Goal:**
Develop a Flask + React MVP that helps students manage stress, anxiety, and burnout through:
- Empathetic AI conversations (Blossoms.ai + OpenRouter)
- Schedule-aware check-ins using Google Calendar
- Personalized journaling and mental health resources
- A gamified “UniQuest Board” that rewards reflection and positive habits

## 🔧 Tech Stack
Frontend: React / Next.js  
Backend: Flask (Python 3.10+)  
Auth: Auth0 (Google login + OAuth 2.0)  
Calendar: Google Calendar API  
AI: Blossoms.ai (sentiment + empathy) + OpenRouter (GPT-4 / Claude)  
Database: Firebase / Supabase  
Hosting: Replit / Render / Vercel

## 🧩 Core Features to Implement

### 1️⃣ Authentication & Context Engine
- Auth0 for secure Google/email login.
- After login, prompt user to select their **school** (dropdown/manual input).
- Store user + school data in Firebase.
- Use Google Calendar OAuth to fetch upcoming events for contextual check-ins.

### 2️⃣ AI Conversation & Emotional Analysis
- `/api/chat` endpoint:
  - Step 1 → Send message to Blossoms.ai → detect emotion.
  - Step 2 → Use emotion as context in OpenRouter prompt → generate empathetic response.
- Return a combined, friendly message to the frontend chat UI.
- Example:  
  > “You sound a bit anxious about tomorrow’s presentation — would you like a 2-minute focus exercise?”

### 3️⃣ Mood Journaling & Insights
- `/api/journal` → log daily mood (emoji/text) to Firebase.
- `/api/summary` → weekly AI-generated summaries from Blossoms/OpenRouter.
- Dashboard: display trends and emotional progress graphs.

### 4️⃣ Global + Local Resource Center
- `/api/resources` returns JSON with:
  - 🌍 **Global resources** (988, 7 Cups, Crisis Text Line)  
  - 🏫 **Local/school resources** (based on selected school)
- Search/filter by category: crisis, therapy, academic stress, financial aid.
- AI integration: when distress is detected, suggest nearby help via gentle prompts.

### 5️⃣ Gamified Engagement — “UniQuest Board”
- A calming, Monopoly-inspired board that encourages reflection and consistency.
- Each tile represents a wellness action (journal, check-in, gratitude, etc.).
- Completing actions advances the player token; looping “GO” grants badges or affirmations.
- Reflection Cards: short, AI-generated affirmations from Blossoms/OpenRouter.
- Design: pastel palette (sage, lavender, gold), soft chimes, no leaderboards.
- Backend: Flask manages badge logic + Reflection Card generation.
- Frontend: React animates board, tracks progress in Firebase.
